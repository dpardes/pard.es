<p>The goal of this blog is to share my experiences with the agile community. I hope to find others on the same path and use our combined knowledge to better the practice of agile. I hope to provide others with the inspiration to keep going, knowing someone else is having the same setbacks and wins. I look forward to collaboration and receiving suggestions and comments from others.</p>
