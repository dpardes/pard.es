I am starting this blog to keep a record of my wins, losses, trials, and joys as I work at the art of agile coaching. I have been worked in agile in many forms (but mostly scrum) as a developer, quality assurer, development manager, project manager, and product owner. I respect and enjoy the art of continuous improvement. The next step in my journey is to codify my learnings and take my coaching to the next level. I have been focusing on teaching agile and scrum to all those I work with in order to improve output, attitude, quality, and overall satisfaction in the software development lifecycle.

The goal of this blog is to share my experiences with the agile community. I hope to find others on the same path and use our combined knowledge to better the practice of agile. I hope to provide others with the inspiration to keep going, knowing someone else is having the same setbacks and wins. I look forward to collaboration and receiving suggestions and comments from others.

Let’s do this…
