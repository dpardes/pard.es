  <li>Intent of the meeting (and why it can’t be accomplish asynchronously)</li>
  <li>Agenda for the meeting (showing why the length is appropriate)</li>
  <li>What I need to do to prepare</li>

<p>If someone can’t tell me those, I’m declining the meeting. And, of course, because I wouldn’t hold anyone to a standard I don’t hold myself to, I’m not scheduling meetings without providing that information in the invite.</p>
