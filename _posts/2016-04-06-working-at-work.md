Getting work done at work is so hard because of all of those meetings. And so many of them don’t feel like a good use of time. So, I’m working on having fewer unproductive meetings. If you want to meet with me, you’ll have to tell me:

- Intent of the meeting (and why it can’t be accomplish asynchronously)
- Agenda for the meeting (showing why the length is appropriate)
- What I need to do to prepare

If someone can’t tell me those, I’m declining the meeting. And, of course, because I wouldn’t hold anyone to a standard I don’t hold myself to, I’m not scheduling meetings without providing that information in the invite.
