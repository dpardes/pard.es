<p>Time is not the enemy. We don’t fall short of the mark because time ran out on us; time is not an active participant in that way. Sure, it moves without our intervention, but the rate at which it moves shouldn’t be shocking. We fall short because we don’t manage time as the precious resource that it is.</p>

<p>I find that that most egregious waste of time is right in front of us: MEETINGS! I’ll take another post to address this specifically, but let me know what types of meeting you think are the most wasteful…</p>
