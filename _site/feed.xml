&lt;p&gt;Time is not the enemy. We don’t fall short of the mark because time ran out on us; time is not an active participant in that way. Sure, it moves without our intervention, but the rate at which it moves shouldn’t be shocking. We fall short because we don’t manage time as the precious resource that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

I always assumed my frustration or disappointment at work was because I cared too much. Friends and family always told me that I had to learn to care less. “Leave work at work” was the sage advice I was given again and again. Since you, kind reader, may not know me, allow me to explain: I cannot leave work at work. Work is a part of my life and I can’t stop living a part of my life just because the clock has struck six. I care deeply about the people in my life and our time spent together, even if it’s at work. So, I can’t possibly care less. But I can focus on caring about the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck and great recruiters have allowed me to work with some of the most talented developers, business analysts, architects, and system administrators in the world. They have all proved to me that there are brilliant people who can do their jobs better than I ever could. But through their eyes, I have learned that I do what I do better than they can. In fact, they rely on me doing a great job so that they can do theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I started as a developer and because of my management training, I’ve wasted a lot of time worried about the how. I, like many other young managers, felt as though the best way to make sure my project got done on time, on budget, and with high quality was to control all the details. As my teams grew and especially as I began to manage multiple teams, it became clear that my detail-control methodology does not scale. To make sure that I can grow as a manager and to make sure that I give my company the most value I can provide, I’ve really started to dig out of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned for those we are looking to do the same: it’s hard to let go. Those who relied on you to fill in the details will take time to adjust to filling in their own blanks. Know that you will not make the switch flawlessly; you will leave things out of both the details and the greater picture. My advice to get through the setbacks: with each mistake, determine where your care and effort could have been better placed to prevent it. Continuous improvement is the name of the game. Keep the big picture in mind; the light at the end of the tunnel will slowly get bigger. Once you feel the warmth of the light, you will never look back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dpardes</name></author><category term="Agile" /><category term="Coaching" /><category term="Project Management" /><summary type="html">I care a lot.

I’ve been a part of some great meetings. All the great meetings that I have been a part of have a few things in common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Short (30 minutes or under)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small (There should be no more than 6 or 8 people)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life Changing (Unless something is going to change, there is no reason to meet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that a there are not exceptions to the points above, but 99.99% of the time, they are true. Also, when leaving a good meeting, I want to work more. Good meetings inspire instead of discourage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/01/09/businessinsiderthis-is-how-larry-pa.DTL&quot;&gt;San Francisco Chronicle published an article&lt;/a&gt; about how Larry Page mandated some changes to meetings at Google. The great thing about a CEO making changes like this is that he can follow through. Not only did he make meetings hinge on decisions, but he gave his employees the ability to decide. He went so far as to reorganize the company to make sure that each product has one person who is available to make hard decisions. One day, I hope to run a company like Mr. Page. Companies and employees should not be scared to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality, you were never in charge, but you told everyone you were.” His words sat with me while I did my usual routine in trying to shepherd code from development to release. I paid attention to how much time I spent “micro-managing.” It was too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today I stepped back officially from my “managing” of the team. After only their second sprint it was obvious that they don’t need me to manage them; they manage themselves. I should be spending my time helping them get work done, not supervising or making their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
