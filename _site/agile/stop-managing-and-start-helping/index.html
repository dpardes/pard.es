  <div class="mt-4"><p>Last week, I read an old blog post on As <a href="http://christopherdaily.com/2011/06/30/how-do-i-start-being-agile-getting-started/">Chris Daily</a> said, people need to “let go of the perception that they are in charge. In reality, you were never in charge, but you told everyone you were.” His words sat with me while I did my usual routine in trying to shepherd code from development to release. I paid attention to how much time I spent “micro-managing.” It was too much.</p>

<p>So, today I stepped back officially from my “managing” of the team. After only their second sprint it was obvious that they don’t need me to manage them; they manage themselves. I should be spending my time helping them get work done, not supervising or making their decisions.</p>

<p>Next week I’m going to be doing more of MY job (not theirs). My job is to coach. I am excited to coach with such a talented and devoted team.</p>
